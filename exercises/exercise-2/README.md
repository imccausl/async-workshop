# Exercise 2

## Creating a countdown

Let's put this all together and try to create a countdown timer with setTimeout. We'll keep it fairly simple and just count down from 3 seconds until New Years. The basic idea is for the console to read out:

```bash
3
2
1
HAPPY NEW YEAR! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
```

There should be a 1 second delay between each number.

To get started, use the following command in your terminal:

`yarn workspace ex-2 start:exercise`
